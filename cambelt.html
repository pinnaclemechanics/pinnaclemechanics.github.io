      <h2>Cambelt Replacement</h2>
      <p>
        Every vehicle has a cambelt, also known as the timing belt, or a timing
        chain. Your car wouldn’t run without it, but it is buried deep within
        the engine, so many of us don’t know much about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst it may be out of sight, you should definitely keep it in mind – a
        timing belt replacement could be costly. Not only that, but a cambelt
        failure could put you in danger, by doing serious damage to the rest of
        your engine. You can significantly reduce the risk of this happening by
        following your manufacturer’s replacement guidelines, so there are
        things you can do to prevent this from becoming a concern.

          <p>
            A cambelt also called a timing belt, regulates your engine’s timing.
            It controls combustion and can cause costly damage when it fails.
            You should book a cambelt change every
            <span class="emphasis">40,000 – 100,000 miles</span> or
            <span class="emphasis">4-6 years</span> or as per the manufacturer
            recommendations in your vehicle handbook.

      <h2>When to replace your cambelt</h2>
      <p>
        Every vehicle has a cambelt, also known as the timing belt, or a timing
        chain. Your car wouldn’t run without it, but it is buried deep within
        the engine, so many of us don’t know much about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst it may be out of sight, you should definitely keep it in mind – a
        timing belt replacement could be costly. Not only that, but a cambelt
        failure could put you in <span class="emphasis">danger</span>, by doing
        serious damage to the rest of your engine. You can significantly reduce
        the risk of this happening by following your manufacturer’s replacement
        guidelines, so there are things you can do to prevent this from becoming
        a concern.
      </p>
      <h2>Reasons for needing your cambelt changed:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Broken or snapped cambelt</span><br />
          A broken cambelt can be caused by a straight cord line rupture, where
          the belt was crimped before it was fitted. Or it might be due to a
          raffled cord line, where a foreign object wedged between the belt and
          pulley, breaking the tensile cords. The belt might have been twisted
          over 90° before fitment. Installation of a timing belt (cambelt) at
          the correct tension is vital. Cars that are usually driven in warmer
          countries with dryer climates will often have their cambelts replaced
          more frequently than those operated in temperate climates. This is
          because the cambelt is made from rubber, and rubber tends to stretch
          when it gets warmer and then contracts as it cools down. Extremes of
          the two temperatures can cause the rubber to develop minor cracks in
          the outer surface of the belt.
          <br />
          If your cambelt was broken or snapped, then the type of engine your
          car has will determine the collateral damage. If it is an interference
          engine, it can cause severe valve damage and damage to engine parts.
          If it is a non-interference engine, then it won’t suffer that much
          damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Cambelt tooth shear</span><br />
          Cambelt tooth shear can be caused by low tension; this includes
          seizure of the driven part or misalignment. Misalignment is one of the
          primary causes of a cambelt failure. If there is too much tooth wear
          or uneven tooth wear, this can all contribute to cambelt tooth shear.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Cambelt tooth wear</span><br />
          Cambelt tooth wear can be caused by what is known as ‘tooth skipping’,
          where your cambelt is under-tensioned and ultimately ‘skips’ some of
          the required teeth. Under-tensioning can also cause excessive or
          uneven tooth wear and excessive drive noise, so use a tension gauge to
          set the correct tension on those timing belts!
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Oil leaks leading to cambelt replacement</span
          ><br />
          Oil can meddle with the cambelt. It can get in the middle of the
          belt’s teeth and can cause the belt to slip and slide and even move
          out of place completely. If you detect any oil leaking from your
          engine then you should get this seen as soon as possible as it could
          cause further harm to your car.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis"
            >Water leaks leading to cambelt replacement</span
          ><br />
          Water leaks will have a comparable effect as oil leaks on your
          cambelt. The impact can be made harsher if the water which is seeping
          has been mingled with antifreeze. If you see that your car is leaking
          water from an odd place, have it checked over by your local mechanic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Older belts</span><br />
          Belts which were installed to earlier cars have angular, trapezoid
          sculpted teeth. Modern car belts have curved teeth which are more
          tolerant and wear out less quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Infrequent driving</span><br />
          The cambelt can come to be stiff if the vehicle is not driven very
          frequently and this can make it weaker. Cars which are driven
          occasionally will often need to have their timing belt changed after
          less miles than cars which are driven consistently.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Cambelt wear and tear</span><br />
          The cambelt can wear out throughout the lifestyle of the car. It is
          highly recommended that you take your car to a garage near you to get
          your car regularly serviced. Always abide by the manufacturer’s
          servicing schedule to ensure problems can be checked before they get
          worse.
