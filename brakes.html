      <h2>Brakes &amp; Disc Replacement</h2>
      <p>
        Different driving patterns have a dramatic effect on how often your
        brakes need servicing. For example, a set of brake pads could last up to
        60,000 miles or more on a car driven mostly on the motorway. However,
        the brakes on the same car driven mostly in busy city centre traffic may
        last only 25,000 miles or less.
      </p>
      <p>
        Front brakes normally wear out before rear brakes because they handle a
        higher percentage of the braking load, especially on front-wheel drive
        cars. It is often recommended that brake pads should be replaced if the
        pad friction material has worn down to a thickness of 3 millimetres.
        Brake disc thickness should be measured if they are at or below the
        manufacturer’s safe minimum thickness specification they should be
        replaced.
      </p>

          <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
          <p>
            Unusual noises while braking and strange vibrations felt through the
            brake pedal could indicate that you have a potential brake problem,
            and you should get this looked into as soon as possible.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>Possible signs that I need my brakes replaced?</h2>
      <p>
        There are several tell-tale signs to look out for when using your brakes
      </p>
      <ul class="no-disc">
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Grinding </span> – when the friction material
          on brake pads is heavily worn, this can result in a grinding noise as
          the brake pad has worn down to the metal calliper. This will likely
          damage the brake disc, also.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Squeaking</span> - there are many reasons why
          brakes squeal. It could suggest the brake calliper has stuck, and the
          brake pad remains partially applied to the disc, but some pads have
          wear indicators that squeal when worn to let the driver know the
          brakes need changing. Either way, you should get this checked out.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Pulsating</span> - If you feel a continuous
          pulsating from the brake pedal whenever you apply the brakes, this
          indicates the brake disc has become warped due to excessive heat.
          Pulsation occurs because the brake disc is distorted and no longer
          provides a perfectly flat surface when the brake pad makes contact. If
          this only occurs when you apply the brakes firmly, it could just be
          the ABS kicking in, but you should have this checked out if you are
          concerned or if it happens regularly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Pulling </span> – if your car pulls to the left
          or right when you apply the brakes, this is usually indicative of a
          sticking hydraulic or mechanical component, such as a seized calliper.
          An inspection can identify the precise reason the vehicle pulls to one
          side
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Sponginess</span> – the brake pedal feels
          spongy, and the brakes seem unresponsive. This is a sign that air has
          entered the brake lines and is preventing the brake fluid from flowing
          through this system effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Soft Brake Pedal</span> – if the brake pedal is
          limp and goes all the way to the floor, this indicates a serious
          braking system fault which you should have inspected immediately. A
          brake pedal that is soft and can be applied all the way to the floor
          usually means the brake fluid is ineffective and needs replacing, but
          there can be several other potential reasons, such as a master
          cylinder fault.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">Dashboard Lights</span> – if a brake warning
          light appears on your instrument panel either continuously or when you
          apply the brakes, it usually means the brake fluid level is critically
          low. This could also indicate a leak in the brake hoses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">High Handbrake</span> – If the handbrake pulls
          up higher than it normally does, it may need adjusting. In modern
          cars, this is usually anything more than 6 to 8 clicks. If the
          handbrake lever reaches the end of its travel, it will fail the MOT.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="emphasis">OlbBrake Fluid</span> – If your brake fluid is
          over 2 years old, it may be losing its effectiveness since it has
          hygroscopic properties, which means it absorbs moisture over time.
          This affects the properties of the fluid, which negatively affects
          braking ability. Brake fluid should be changed approximately every two
          years
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For safety’s sake, it’s <span class="emphasis">important</span> to have
        your vehicle inspected as quickly as possible when you notice any of the
        above symptoms.
