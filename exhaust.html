      <h2>Exhaust Repair &amp; Replacement</h2>
      <p>
        The main function of an exhaust system in a vehicle is to maintain
        engine performance and reduce emissions. Common components of an exhaust
        system include the exhaust manifold, catalytic converter, silencer,
        oxygen sensor and tailpipe, among other smaller parts.
        <br />
        When fuel is burnt during the combustion process, the engine will emit
        gases that need to get out of the vehicle - this is where the ingenious
        exhaust system comes into play. The exhaust manifold collects these
        gases and directs them to the catalytic converter, which is designed to
        reduce the amount of pollutants in the exhaust gases. The catalytic
        converter contains a mesh-like structure coated with a combination of
        precious metals, such as platinum and palladium, which convert harmful
        pollutants into less harmful substances like carbon dioxide.
        <br />
        While the silencer reduces the noise produced during this process, the
        tailpipe helps direct the fumes to the rear of the vehicle.
        <br />
        The UK has a strict set of emission standards which regulates the limit
        of pollutants from vehicles on the road to reduce the negative impact of
        transport on the environment. It’s important to ensure that a vehicle
        exhaust system is well-maintained and inspected to ensure that it meets
        these emission standards.
      </p>
      <h2>Exhaust services we offer</h2>
      <p class="emphasis">Catalytic Converter Replacement</p>
      <p>
        Catalytic converter replacement is the process of cutting and removing
        the malfunctioning catalytic converter and replacing it with a new one
        so it can perform its function of reducing the amount of harmful
        pollutants during the combustion process. It can wear out over a period
        of time and is often the target for criminals as it includes precious
        minerals.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">EGR Valve replacement</p>
      <p>
        During an EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve replacement, the clogged
        up or malfunctioning valve is inspected and replaced with a new part.
        During this process, the associated vacuum pipes and connections are
        removed to access the old part and replaced appropriately so it can
        reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted from the exhaust system by
        recirculating some of the exhaust gases back into the engine.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">Exhaust Manifold repair</p>
      <p>
        During an exhaust manifold repair, the general process is to remove the
        damaged manifold and then replace it. The exhaust ports are also
        thoroughly inspected for damage before the new exhaust manifold is
        installed.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">Catalytic Converter Replacement</p>
      <p>
        Catalytic converter replacement is the process of cutting and removing
        the malfunctioning catalytic converter and replacing it with a new one
        so it can perform its function of reducing the amount of harmful
        pollutants during the combustion process. It can wear out over a period
        of time and is often the target for criminals as it includes precious
        minerals.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">Car Oxygen Sensor replacement</p>
      <p>
        During a car oxygen sensor replacement process, sometimes referred to as
        “lambda sensor”, the sensor responsible for measuring the amount of
        oxygen in the exhaust gases is inspected and replaced. This sensor is
        critical to ensure the air-to-fuel ratio is maintained in real-time and
        can wear out over a period of time.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">PCV Valve replacement</p>
      <p>
        With a PCV or Positive Crankcase Ventilation valve replacement, the
        clogged or malfunctioning valve is inspected and replaced so it can
        perform its function of venting blow-by gases and oil vapor from the
        crankcase back into the intake manifold.
